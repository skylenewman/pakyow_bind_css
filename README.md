This is a Pakyow v0.10 project.

# Pakyow Bind CSS

This is a quick excursion to prototype code to support user-generated CSS to style elements on your Pakyow app. Think MySpace.

When finished, this repo should show:

* Binding CSS to node in header
* Binding styles to body node(s)
* Generating a CSS file from values, pushing to AWS, and serving _that_ file on a page
* Binding CSS from static variables (simulating DB call)
* Binding CSS built from JSON

# Getting Started

Start the server:

  `bundle exec pakyow server`

You'll find your app running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

Need to interact with your code? Fire up a console:

  `bundle exec pakyow console`
